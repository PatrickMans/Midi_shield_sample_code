#Midi Shield Sample Code

![](midishield.gif?raw=true "Midi Shield Schematic")

## USAGE:
Make sure when programming the arduino, the midi-in circuit is not connected to pin2 (RX). Flip the switch to
connect/disconnect it.

## THE CODE:
Initially, the template code is sending all midi input directly to the midi output (thru mode). 
Adapt the callback routines to get the desired function.
